My name is Brandon Roddey, and I'm an Arabic and French linguist and former ESL teacher in the early phases of his coding career. After taking Dr. Charles Severance's "Python for Everybody" course (https://www.py4e.com) and receiving positive feedback about my interests from my programmer friends, I decided to take the plunge into the developer universe. I'm currently studying how to implement APIs (excellent tutorial here on how to build a program that uses the Twitter API and the Microsoft Azure language analytics APIs: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/how-to-analyze-the-sentiment-of-your-own-tweets). My end goal is to develop technologies to support second-language learners and enrich their interactions with foreign language digital media content on the web. I'm also interested in integrating research from second-language acquisition and instructional design to create new language learning tools and improve existing ones.
